# PSCode-Interpreter

The PSCode programming lanuage is very basic and is intended for educational use. It mimics the style of pseudocode I was taught as a Software Design and Development student, and wasted countless hours pouring over for my 2025 HSC -  writing madeup code on paper like it's the 1960s.  

The "How To Use This Program" word document provides information as to EBNFs, as well as tips to install.

Hopefully, this extremely basic programming language can utterly extinguish my HSC pseudocode trauma.
